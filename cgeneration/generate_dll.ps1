# This is a PowerShell script that performs the following steps:
# 1. Copy foo.m, generated when running OpenSim/External_Functions/<filename>.cpp, in the current folder.
# 2. Generate c code (foo_jac.c), containing the function F and its Jacobian, in a format that can be exploited by CasADi.
# 3. Build and install a dynamically linked library (.dll) from the c code.
# 4. Delete foo.m and foo_jac.c.

# There are a few settings you may want to adjust depending on your target external function and on how things are organized on your machine:
# 1. $filename is the name of your .cpp file: OpenSim/External_Functions/<filename>.cpp. 
# 2. $nInputs_F is the total number of elements in the input vectors of the function F described in OpenSim/External_Functions/<filename>.cpp. 
#       In the example external functions, we have:    
#           PredSim: 87
#           PredSim_pp: 87
#           PredSim_SSCM: 87
#           PredSim_SSCM_pp: 87
#           PredSim_v2: 93
#           PredSim_v2_pp: 93
#           PredSimProsthesis: 87
#           PredSimProsthesis_pp: 87
#           TrackSim_1: 58
#           TrackSim_2: 141
#           PredSim_2D: 30
#           PredSim_2D_pp: 30
# 3. $path_opensim_build_external_functions is the path to the External_Functions folder located in the OpenSim build folder.
# 4. $path_external_functions is the path to an existing folder, eg. external_functions, in which a folder <filename> will be created with the build and install folders of each external function. 
# 5. $path_cgeneration is the path the folder containing this PowerShell script.
# 6. $compiler is by default set to Visual Studio 2017. For Visual Studio 2015, change to "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64".
